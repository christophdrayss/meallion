meallion is a universal online grocery ordering system based on a scalable and dynamic recipe database that uses machine learning to identify ingredients and collect food data.

:tomato::eggplant::corn::tangerine::pizza::spaghetti::stew:

The meallion project consists of a mySQL recipe database and allowes recipe searches by keywords or ingredients. The search queries are run by Apache Lucene, one of the world's most powerful full-text search engine algorithms, that is also used by Twitter(c).
The database consists of a simplified structure of recipe, ingredient and menu objects as well as joint-tables.  
- A recipe is a compilation of ingredients.  
- A menu is a compilation of recipes.

meallion offers a fully-featured html front-end that allows users to select recipes, save them in personalized HTTP sessions and compile grocery carts.
These generated grocery shopping carts can be exported as JSON or XMLs strings and used universially - e.g. to send to grocery suppliers as a qualified consumer lead. 

In addition to the front-end, meallion offers widgets, that can be integrated on food bloggers' pages. These widgets allow users to add blogger recipes to their shopping cart on the meallion platform without clicking out fro the blogger website (via iframes).

The meallion database on meallion.de is constantly growing. To help the database scale, meallion integrates an AI-based ingredients detection feature for food pictures. As an example: uploading a picture of a plate of Paella will let meallion detect the ingredient "rice".

## 1. Database / base model

meallion uses the Java hibernate / JPA framework to communicate with mySQL. The base model includes the following object in /orm (object relationship model):
 
- Recipe
- Ingredient
- MealPlan
- IngredientRecipe (matching table)
- MealPlanRecipe (matching table)

- IngredientRecipePK (primary key object for matching purposes)
- MealPlanRecipePK (primary key object for matching purposes)

The object **MealPlanIngredient** is NOT part of the orm part. This object is temporarily generated by **MealPlan.GetMealPlanIngredients()** to dynamically match ingredients to mealplans.
Before creating a **MealPlanIngredient**, you should ideally update the ingredient amounts of a **MealPlan** first: **UpdateIngredientAmounts()**. This function merges together all ingredients of all recipes of one mealplan.

Example:
One **MealPlan** holds these tree **Recipe** objects: "One Potato with eggs", "One Potato with butter", "One Potato with sauce".
Calling **MealPlan.UpdateIngredientAmounts()** will merge the total ingredients together, i.e. calculating that 3 potatoes are needed in total.
Calling **MealPlan.GetMealPlanIngredients(**) will then return a list of **MealPlanIngredient** objects, which holds one **Ingredient** object and an amount number.

## 2. Client-server communication

meallion.de offers several webhooks to interact with the server:

## 3. Search engine

meallion.de runs Solr (http://meallion.de:8983/solr/meallion). 
The **features.SearchEngine** object can run searches based on user input on the landing page. The result is a **SearchResults** object, which holds a list of **Recipe** objects or **Mealplan** objects found as well as a meta integer, giving information about how/if the search went well.

The method SearchEngine.IndexAll() downloads the entire database and reindexes it into Solr documents.

## 4. Init to run on local machine

1. In the resources folder, make sure the persistence.xml file contains the content of the file persistence_FOR LOCAL USE.xml.
2. Copy the meallion.conf file into the WEB-INF folder
3. replace https://www.meallion.de with http://localhost/Meallion everywhere in the project
3. Now meallion should run on local machine, connecting to meallion.de mySQL and Lucene.
